This code was written for an assignment at McMaster. 


First run the server code of the form below where <input file> ends in .txt and is inside the folder input_file. It will then start the server and print the server name. 

python server.py <input file>


Next run the client of the form below where <output file> ends in .txt and is inside the folder output_file. <server> is printed when you run server.py.

python client.py <server> <output file>


Note: To stop executing server.py on Linux use CTRL+C and on Windows the most reliable way is CTRL + Pause.
